                  The Keshavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case (1973) is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of
                  India that established the "basic structure doctrine" of the Constitution. It arose from a challenge
                  to the Kerala government's land reform legislation, which sought to reduce the powers of religious
                  institutions over land. The Court ruled that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution,
                  it cannot alter its fundamental framework or basic structure, which includes principles such as the
                  supremacy of the Constitution, the rule of law, and the separation of powers. This doctrine has since
                  been pivotal in maintaining the balance between parliamentary sovereignty and constitutional supremacy
                  in India.

                  that addressed the issue of sexual harassment of women at the workplace. The case arose after a social
                  worker, Bhanwari Devi, was gang-raped while trying to protect a child marriage case. The Court
                  recognized that the absence of clear laws on sexual harassment violated women's rights to equality and
                  dignity under the Constitution. It laid down comprehensive guidelines to prevent and address sexual
                  harassment in workplaces, emphasizing the need for mechanisms to ensure safe work environments for
                  women. This judgment served as a critical step towards the eventual enactment of the Sexual Harassment
                  of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act in 2013, underscoring the importance
                  of legal protections against such violations.

                  The Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India case (1978) is a pivotal Supreme Court ruling that expanded the
                  interpretation of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.
                  Maneka Gandhi challenged the government's decision to impose a travel ban on her without providing any
                  reasons, arguing that it violated her rights. The Court held that the procedure established by law
                  must be fair, just, and reasonable, thereby linking the right to life with the principles of natural
                  justice. This judgment not only broadened the scope of Article 21 but also emphasized that fundamental
                  rights cannot be abrogated without due process, reinforcing the protection of individual freedoms
                  against arbitrary state action. It marked a significant shift towards a more substantive
                  interpretation of rights in India.

                  The Shah Bano case (1985) is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of India that addressed the
                  rights of Muslim women to alimony after divorce. Shah Bano, a divorced Muslim woman, sought
                  maintenance from her ex-husband under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Supreme Court
                  ruled in her favor, stating that the right to maintenance is not limited by personal laws and must
                  adhere to the principles of justice and equality under the Constitution. This judgment emphasized that
                  all women, regardless of religion, are entitled to maintenance and highlighted the need for reform in
                  personal laws to align them with constitutional rights. The ruling sparked significant political and
                  social debates, ultimately leading to the enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on
                  Divorce) Act, 1986, aimed at limiting alimony and altering the legal landscape for Muslim women in
                  India.

                  the imposition of President's Rule in states. The Court held that this power should be exercised with
                  caution and only under specific circumstances, emphasizing that the arbitrary dismissal of a state
                  government undermines the democratic process. It established that the judiciary could review the
                  proclamation of President's Rule and laid down guidelines to prevent its misuse, reinforcing the
                  importance of federalism and the rights of states within the Indian Constitution. This case
                  significantly strengthened the balance of power between the Centre and state governments.

                  life under Article 21 of the Constitution, emphasizing that urban poor have a right to be heard before
                  being evicted, thereby upholding their dignity and access to sustenance.

                  and those who have benefited from affirmative action, thereby ensuring that reservations do not
                  perpetuate socio-economic backwardness.

                  ultimately ruling against allowing Arunaâ€™s euthanasia but acknowledging the right to die with dignity.
                  The judgment also called for comprehensive legislation on euthanasia.

                  and affirming that love and sexual orientation are intrinsic aspects of human identity.
